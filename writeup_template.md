# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

---

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 6 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I blurred it with gaussian.  I used Canny algorithm to detect edge. Next, I applied a region of interest mast to filter out. Finally, I used the Hough transform to find lines from Canny edge.


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 

Another shortcoming could be ...


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline
